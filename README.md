# NFTMarketplaceDApp

Welcome to NFTMarketplaceDApp, a decentralized application (DApp) on the Ethereum blockchain designed to facilitate the secure and transparent trading of digital assets through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This project aims to harness the power of blockchain technology to offer a platform for creators and collectors to mint, buy, sell, and auction digital assets with ease and security.

## Features

### NFT Contract Development (ERC-721)
- Minting functionality for creating digital assets with unique identifiers and metadata URLs.
- Batch minting capabilities to optimize gas usage.
- Ownership transfer restrictions and royalty payment options for creators.

### Marketplace Contract
- Management of the buying, selling, and auctioning of NFTs.
- Bidding functionality with a time-based auction system.
- Direct purchase and offer-making capabilities between users.

### Backend Integration
- A NodeJS backend service interacting with smart contracts using web3.js.
- Integration with a wallet service for user authentication and transactions.
- Endpoints for fetching NFT data, listing items on the marketplace, and executing transactions.
